        <h4>Tacos</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 pound extra-lean ground beef</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon taco seasoning</li>
                <li>salt & pepper to taste</li>
                <li>4 hard taco shells</li>
                <li>1 cup grated cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>4 mini flatbread</li>
                <li>1 cup iceberg lettuce</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Spicy Ranch Sauce</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons ranch seasoning</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon hot sauce (such as tabasco)</li>
            </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 F. Heat a large skillet over high heat, breaking up ground beef with a spoon and seasoning with salt & pepper. Add taco seasoning and cook for 10 minutes until fully cooked.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, mix sour cream with ranch seasoning and hot sauce. Divide taco meat among hard taco shells and set aside.</li>
            <li>Divide cheese overtop of flatbreads, then bake in the oven for 5 minutes until cheese has started to melt. Remove from oven, then wrap around hard taco shells, pressing gently.</li>
            <li>Add spicy ranch sauce to tacos, followed by lettuce and a tiny bit more cheese. Serve and enjoy!</li>
